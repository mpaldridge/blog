**Mitt Romney** is a former Governor of Massachusetts, a former Presidential candidate for the Republican party, and a current US senator for Utah.

**Gail Collins** is a journalist who writes an op-ed column for the _New York Times_.

Gail Collins likes to mention the fact that Mitt Romney once drove to Canada with the family dog strapped to the roof of the car. In fact, she has mentioned this story over 100 times in the *Times*.

In case you don't know the story, Collins lays out the details in her first mention of the Romney/dog story, back in August 2007:

> Every time I see [Mitt Romney], all I can think about is Seamus the dog.
> Seamus, in case you missed the story, was the Romneys' Irish setter
> back in the early 1980s. Mitt used to drive the family from Boston to
> Ontario every summer for a vacation, with the dog strapped to the roof
> in a crate. As The Boston Globe reported this summer, Romney had the
> entire trip planned so rigidly that every gas station stop was
> predetermined before departure. During the fatal trip of '83, Seamus
> apparently needed one more than the schedule allowed. When evidence of
> the setter's incontinence came running down the back windshield,
> Romney abandoned his itinerary and drove to the closest gas station,
> where he got a hose and sprayed both dog and station wagon clean.  
> ([Haunted by Seamus](https://www.nytimes.com/2007/08/04/opinion/04collins.html), 4/8/07)

As she later explained,

> I’ve made a kind of game of trying to mention Seamus every time I write about Mitt Romney. This is because the Republican primary campaign has been an extremely long and depressing slog, and we need all the diversion we can get.  
> ([Dogging Mitt Romney](http://www.nytimes.com/2012/03/08/opinion/collins-dogging-mitt-romney.html), 7/3/12)

In 2022 -- 15 years after she first mentioned the story, and 10 years after I started this list -- various *Times* writers were invited to consider something they had been wrong about. Collins's answer, worryingly, suggests an awareness of this very list:

> When Romney was running for president, I tried to see how many times I could find a way to mention that the candidate once drove to Canada with a dog named Seamus strapped to the roof of his car. The result was sort of epic. People wound up counting and I used the story more than 80 times. Which was … kind of a lot.  
> ([I Was Wrong About Mitt Romney (and His Dog)](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/07/21/opinion/gail-collins-mitt-romney.html), 21/7/22)

What follows is a list of every time I can find that Collins has mentioned the Romney/dog story.

*(Have I missed any Collins/Romney/dog mentions?  Contact me on Twitter: I'm [@mpaldridge](https://twitter.com/mpaldridge).  For the avoidance of doubt, I think it's a funny bit, and this list is made from admiration, not criticism.  Some dates might be off by one day, as print/web publication dates are different. Dates are in UK format, sorry.)*

**Current Tally:** 108 (90 op-ed columns and 18 "conversations" with other writers)  
**Last updated:** February 2023 (first update of any kind for 6 years, and first complete update for almost a decade, with 22 new mentions!)

**108:** *Bret:* Gail, you know how you now regret giving Mitt Romney (and his dog Seamus) such a hard time, considering what the party came up with next? I bet Haley is the one Republican you’d more or less be all right with as president.  
*Gail:* Hmm. Does she have any pet-transportation stories?  
(Politicians Everywhere All at Once, conversation with Bret Stephens, 6/2/23)

**107:** I’ve already publicly apologized for my anti-Romney crusade. Although I’ve still got a plastic dog-on-the-roof-of-a-car someone sent me when I was, um, obsessing on his animal transport policy. Keeping it by my desk. (Is There Anything That Will Make the 'Former Guy' Go Away?, conversation with Bret Stephens, 3/10/22)

**106:** The story about the dog on the roof came from a Boston Globe profile in which his son told a reporter about the time their pet pooped from his perch and messed up the car’s rear window. It was supposed to be an example of Romney’s sense of organization. Got that car and dog hosed down at a nearby service station. I’d probably have stopped mentioning it if Romney, when asked about the story, had said something like: "Yeah, it was back when my sons were little — nobody could possibly drive from Massachusetts to Canada with five boys and an Irish setter hopping around the back. And you know, he was in a really safe crate." But no, he just bristled and retorted, "The dog likes fresh air." (I Was Wrong About Mitt Romney (and His Dog), 21/7/22)

**105:** Hey, a whole lot of us owe Mitt an apology for one thing or the other. Still sorry about making fun of you for putting your dog Seamus on the roof of your car, Senator. (Putin Is Spinning the Globe Faster and Faster, conversation with Bret Stephens, 28/2/22)

**104:** Yeah, I’ve certainly gotten over that dog on the roof of [Mitt Romney's] car. (Joe Biden Is as Puzzled by the Senate as You Are, conversation with Bret Stephens, 21/6/21)

**103:** But there was also a pet angle that allowed me to revisit the saga of Mitt Romney driving with a dog on the car roof. (Just When You Thought Politics Couldn’t Unravel Any Further, conversation with Bret Stephens, 22/2/21)

**102:** So if you were a dog, would you rather belong to Ted Cruz or Mitt Romney? Yes, you have to choose. Perhaps you remember that many, many years ago, Romney drove to Canada for a family vacation with his Irish setter Seamus on the roof of his car. I mentioned this fact about two million times when Romney ran for president, mainly to break up the tedium of a very boring campaign. (Ted Cruz Is Going to the Dogs, 19/2/21)

**101:** 1. President Biden met with Republican moderates to try to negotiate a relief package. Looking around the room, he said, "I feel like ..."  
[...]  
C. "I finally understand how Mitt Romney's dog felt attached to the roof of that car."  
(Pandemic Politics: Take the Quiz, 4/2/21)

**100:** Romney ran for governor of Massachusetts on a pro-choice platform, then ran for president as “proud to be pro-life.” His explanation that he did not formerly understand what an embryo was is one of my favorite Mitt stories. Second only to the time he drove to Canada with the family dog strapped to the roof of the car.  Now, when Mitt voted to convict Trump I swore I’d never bring up the dog again. But a person has the right to change her mind, right? (The Republican Irritation Olympics, 23/9/20)

**99:** When history looks back on Mitt Romney, this should be the moment that gets remembered. Not the uninspiring presidential race or political flip-flops. Not even the time he drove to Canada with a dog on the roof of the car. (Think Trump’s Learned a Lesson? Hahahaha, 5/2/20)

**98:** 7. When Mitt Romney called the Ukraine story "troubling," Trump called Romney ...  
[...]  
C. "A well-known dog abuser."  
(Thanksgiving Day Quiz, 28/11/19)

**N/A:** *Bret:* I’m specifically thinking of [...] (your favorite dog lover) Mitt Romney of Utah. (There Is Nothing This Man Can’t Wreck, conversation with Bret Stephens that doesn't count because only Stephens brought it up, 29/10/19)

**97:** Romney is the senator from Utah, a job he could keep if he got caught torturing puppies. This was not meant to remind you of the time he drove to Canada with the family Irish setter in a crate on the station wagon’s roof. Time editor Anand Giridharadas already took care of that when he tweeted, "Mitt, it is time to strap the dog of courage onto the car of your constitutional obligations." (Trump Tanks, Republicans Dither, 2/10/19)

**96:** Deeply, deeply cynical as I am about Mitt Romney, I would never argue that he wouldn’t be 10 times better a president. And while it’s true I once made fun of Romney’s dog, we have to remember that we now have the first president ever who has never had a pet in his entire life. (Is 2019 Over Yet?, conversation with Bret Stephens, 15/1/19)

**95:** And thanks to voters in Utah, there will be new opportunities to discuss the fact that once, long ago, Senator-elect Mitt Romney drove to Canada on a family vacation with the dog strapped to the roof of his car. (Trump Is a Really Happy Loser, 7/11/18)

**94:** *Gail:* If you mention Mitt Romney I get to bring up his dog.  
*Bret:* Let’s just leave the dog on the car roof, shall we?  
(Donald Trump, Live and Unfiltered!, conversation with Bret Stephens, 1/5/18)

**93:** Romney has to do better. Otherwise, we’ll go back to discussing the time he drove to Canada with the family dog strapped to the car roof. (A New Mitt or the Same Old Weenie?, 25/4/18)

**92:** The only time anybody in the White House ever quoted me in public was when I was writing about Mitt Romney’s dog. (The Polar Bear in the Room, conversation with Bret Stephens, 6/6/17)

**91:** I used to think I’d be happy with anyone who didn’t drive to Canada with the family dog strapped to the roof. ([Have These Been the Best Two Weeks of Trump’s First 100 Days?](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/18/opinion/have-these-been-the-best-two-weeks-of-trumps-first-100-days.html), conversation with Matt Labash, 18/4/17)

**90:** And, of course, [Mitt Romney is] the guy who once drove to Canada with the family Irish setter strapped to the roof of the car. The worst part was his excuse — not “too many kids in the back seat” but “my dog loves fresh air.” Somewhere, the spirit of Seamus is laughing.

**89:** I used to enjoy occasionally pointing out that Mitt Romney had once driven his family to Canada with Seamus the Irish setter strapped to the roof of the car. A campaign consultant told me that the Seamus story elicited stronger reactions from focus groups than any other aspect of the 2012 campaign. ([And Now, Presidential Dog Days](http://www.nytimes.com/2016/09/24/opinion/and-now-presidential-dog-days.html), 23/9/16)

[...]

**87:** The future holds no chances to point out that Romney once drove to Canada with the family Irish setter strapped to the roof of the station wagon. ([Mitt Quits. Again. Probably.](http://www.nytimes.com/2015/01/31/opinion/gail-collins-mitt-quits-again-probably.html) 30/1/15)

**86:** So many old friends popping up this month — Mitt Romney and now Rick Perry. The man who drove to Canada with the family dog strapped to the car roof** and the man who claims he shot a coyote while jogging.

(First Pop Quiz of 2015, 1/1/2015)

**84:** Mitt Romney is back. Don’t leap to any conclusions. After all, there are a lot of different ways to be back. You can be back as in “back running for president.” Or just back as in “back in the public eye.” Or back driving to Canada with a dog strapped to the car roof. ([Mitt! Again! What?](http://www.nytimes.com/2014/06/19/opinion/gail-collins-romney-and-the-2016-contenders-huddle.html), 18/6/14)

**83:** You’ve completely ignored Hillary, who I remember talking with great enthusiasm about her dog. His name was – or I guess still is – Seamus, the same as the Romneys’ Irish setter who got carted to Canada on the roof of the car. ([Pet Theories](http://opinionator.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/01/08/pet-theories/), conversation with David Brooks, 8/1/14)

**79:** Supporters hope that the discovery will lead to a reconsideration of Romney’s entire life  [...] They plan to open a theme park that will focus on the positive side of the man known to history only as a politician who once attempted to drive to Canada with his dog strapped to the roof of his car. ([My Kingdom for a Corpse](http://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/07/opinion/collins-my-kingdom-for-a-corpse.html), 6/2/13)

**78:** As Romney’s SUV approached the White House grounds, police stopped a man who tried to reach for the car yelling “Mitt! Mitt!” It wasn’t clear what he had in mind. Perhaps he was an angry dog lover who still hasn’t gotten over the fact that Romney once drove to Canada with an Irish setter strapped to the car roof. ([Mitt's Oval Office Moment](http://www.nytimes.com/2012/12/01/opinion/collins-mitts-oval-office-moment.html) 30/11/12)

**77:** It appears that Mitt Romney was a terrible presidential candidate. 
 O.K., some people have known that ever since the story broke about strapping his dog on the car roof.  ([Anybody Notice a Pattern?](http://www.nytimes.com/2012/11/17/opinion/collins-anybody-notice-a-pattern.html), 16/11/12)

**74:** Maybe someday, the voters of 2012 will be telling their grandchildren where they were when Mitt Romney evoked Women in Binders. By then, of course, they will have gotten a little fuzzy about the details. Maybe they’ll tell the kids that, in the end, the whole election came down to the time Mitt Romney put Big Bird in a binder on the car roof.

**73:** Democrats miss Seamus. Yes, those were the days. When the very mention of “Mitt Romney” would instantly lead to a discussion of the dangers of transporting an Irish setter to Canada on the roof of a station wagon. “Has Seamus peaked too early?” a worried Democrat asked me in Texas a while back. At the time, I thought that anybody who is a Democrat in Texas had so many things to worry about, it was a miracle he could even remember the dog’s name. But now it’s clear that he was totally right. Seamus was so June. ([Democrats at the Deep End](http://www.nytimes.com/2012/10/11/opinion/collins-democrats-at-the-deep-end.html), 10/10/12)

**71:** 1. Shortly before the Republican convention opened, a new book quoted Mitt Romney as comparing the Tea Party to: [...]

**69:** First of all, Paul Ryan and Mitt Romney are _not_ the same person. [...] Ryan is the one who likes to catch catfish by sticking his fist into their burrows and dragging them out by the throat. Romney is the one who drove to Canada with his dog strapped to the car roof. ([Political Page Turners](http://www.nytimes.com/2012/08/18/opinion/collins-political-page-turners.html), 17/8/12)

**67:** The Republicans currently have a symbolic legislative agenda and a presidential candidate who can be in two places at one time, but whom nobody likes. Other than that, it’s all good. Nobody’s brought up the dog on the car roof for days. 
([Mitt's Political Vortex](http://www.nytimes.com/2012/07/14/opinion/collins-mitts-political-vortex.html), 13/7/12)

**66:** We are not talking about business taxes, in the normal sense of the word. If we were, it would quickly become so incredibly confusing that you would be begging me to go back to the matter of the dog Romney once tied to the roof of his car.

**64:** You may remember the cringe-inducing moment in 2007 when [Mitt Romney] started bragging about his prowess as an outdoorsman. [...] Inquiring minds checked the hunting licenses in all the places that Mitt had at some point called home and determined that he’d never applied for one. “I’ve always been a rodent and rabbit hunter,” he amended. “Small varmints, if you will.” [...] But until he dropped out of the race, varmint hunting was the dog on the roof of Romney’s 2008 campaign.

**62:** I kind of like the logjam. I am seeing Mitt, in lumberjack garb, in the middle of a river full of downed trees and the occasional committee chairman. Perhaps the Romney boys are along, singing family songs. Maybe the dog is strapped to a fallen sycamore.

**61:** Our subject for today is: Presidential nominating conventions — why are they still around? Other possible subjects were: [...] The new sensation of dancing dogs on TV talent shows and how many of them do you think were ever made to ride on the roof of a car?   ([It's Their Party](http://www.nytimes.com/2012/05/19/opinion/collins-its-their-party.html), 16/5/12)

**60:** [Mitt Romney] is a guy who is not capable of taking responsibility for his past actions. I’m not just talking about the fact that he can’t bring himself to say it wasn’t a good idea to drive to Canada with the family dog on the roof of his car. ([Playing Left, Right — or Center](http://opinionator.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/05/16/playing-left-right-or-center/), conversation with David Brooks, 16/5/12)

**59:** Perhaps you may remember that Romney once drove to Canada with the family Irish setter stuck in a cage on the station wagon roof. When he was originally asked about it, he claimed the dog “loves fresh air.”
This was more than four years ago. What would have happened if Romney had just said: “Boy, in retrospect that really does sound like a bad idea. But you have to remember that we had five boys under the age of 14. It was like living in a vortex; we did all kinds of stupid stuff.”
Do you think the nation — particularly the part that has ever tried to drive long distances with a car full of children — would have been understanding? I personally would never have mentioned the incident at all.
But since we haven’t gotten that sort of input, I kind of feel free to bring it up now and then.   ([The Anatomy of a Jokester](http://www.nytimes.com/2012/05/12/opinion/collins-the-anatomy-of-a-jokester.html), 11/5/12)

**58:** The only absolute rule is to discount things a presidential candidate did before age 18. If Mitt Romney names Marco Rubio as his vice presidential nominee, it is not fair to point out that Rubio was also once a Mormon because the conversion and deconversion happened between the ages of 8 and 13. Also eating dog meat when you are a child in Indonesia is not the same thing as driving to Canada with the family Irish setter strapped to the roof of the car when you are 36.

**57:** Did you ever notice how many of the Republican candidates seemed to have animal issues? Rick Perry shot that coyote, and Jon Huntsman got bitten by a goat — really, that was the high point of the Huntsman campaign. Also, Senator Rob Portman of Ohio, the veep front-runner, recently imitated a chicken on television.

**53:** If Romney couldn’t even take a clear stand on Rush Limbaugh’s Slutgate, why would he say anything that forthright unless it was a total error?

**52:** I don’t know if I’ve ever mentioned this, but Mitt Romney once drove to Canada with the family Irish setter on the roof of the car. Seamus, the dog-on-the-roof, has become a kind of political icon. [...] The story took place in 1983, when the Romney family made a 12-hour pilgrimage from Boston to a vacation home in Canada. Romney, his wife, Ann, and their five sons were in the station wagon. Seamus was in a crate, or kennel, on the roof.
At some point — possibly in response to the excitement about being passed by tractor-trailers while floating like a furry maraschino cherry on top of the car, Seamus developed diarrhea. And Romney, who had designated all the acceptable rest stops before beginning the trip, was forced to make an unscheduled trip to a gas station. Where he kept the family in the car while he hosed down the station wagon and the dog, then returned to the highway. [...] Elect Mitt Romney and he will take the nation on the road to the future. Some of us will be stuck on the roof. [...] I’ve made a kind of game of trying to mention Seamus every time I write about Mitt Romney. [...]
This is a real person. A person who once drove to Canada with the family dog tied to the roof of the car.

**51:** _David Brooks:_ I feel for Mitt Romney. Think of it. There he was a few years ago sitting on the front porch of his fourth summer home innocently wondering why the trees of New England are so unpleasantly tall, and he turns to his buddies, who own Nascar teams, hotel chains, political parties and various small emirates, and he asks them if it would be a good idea if he ran for president.
They point out that a presidential campaign would allow him to recite obscure verses of patriotic songs all across America, so he agrees to do it.

pass a law against driving to Canada with an Irish setter tied to the
roof of the car.
(Opening Newt's Marriage, 20/1/12)

**43:** And, while we’re at it, if you were that rich and had a very large
family to take to Canada, wouldn’t you hire a plane? What kind of
obsession is it that makes a multi-multi-multimillionaire show up for
the GoldenTree Asset Management convention for a $68,000 fee? Or drive
for 12 hours with the Irish setter strapped to the car roof?
(Anchors Aweigh, My Boys, 18/1/12) 

**42:** How many other major presidential candidates in recent history came from the business sector? How many drove to Canada with their family dog strapped to the roof of the car? (Who Still Wants to Be a Millionaire? 13/1/12)

**41:** And now Newt’s Web site has a video that basically asks whether America will elect a president who once drove to Canada with the family dog strapped to the roof of the car. Which is, of course, an excellent question. (The Primary Primer, 11/1/12)

**40:** Did I ever mention that Romney once drove to Canada with the family Irish setter strapped to the roof of the car? The dog’s name was Seamus. New Hampshire Republicans, if you can’t think of anybody to vote for on Tuesday, consider writing in the name Seamus when you go to the polls. (The March of the Non-Mitts, 4/1/12)

**39:** [The Gingrich] campaign’s highlight of the week may have been the
announcement that it was creating a “Pets With Newt” Web site to
highlight the candidate’s love of animals.  “Pets With Newt” may be an
attempt to remind Iowans that Mitt Romney once drove to Canada with
the family Irish setter strapped to the roof of the car. This is
clearly a weak point in the Mitt armor, which came up this week in a
Wall Street Journal interview with the candidate. “Uh — love my dog.
That’s all I got for you,” Romney responded.
(Remember the Alamo, 24/12/11)

**38:** Romney 2012 makes it sound as if he came into office and found
abortion rights sitting in a dusty cardboard box in the closet and was
chagrined when he remembered he had promised not to throw anything
out. It would be as if he explained that trip to Canada with the
family dog strapped to the roof of the station wagon by saying: “I had
the experience of going to get into the car and there was already a
dog on the roof. So I turned on the ignition and I was effectively
driving.”
(An Early Holiday Hangover, 16/12/11)

**37:** I would say this is an extremely safe position for Romney to take
because the odds are very good that no one has ever called Mitt zany
in his entire life. Unless it was when he drove to Canada with the
family dog strapped to the roof of the station wagon. (“Hey, Mister,
you got an Irish setter on top of your car. What are you, zany or
something?”)
(Mitt's Zest for Zings, 14/12/11)

**36:** And maybe we could get over [Mitt Romney's] driving to Canada with the family dog
strapped to the roof of the car if he’d just admit it was because he
was too cheap to hire a dog-sitter. Maybe.
(The Mitt Romney Pardon, 30/11/11)

**35:** _David Brooks:_ That gives us a chance to talk about Romney and his
weaknesses, which are glaring.  
_Gail Collins:_ Dog on the roof of the car. Dog on the roof of the car.
(The Not-Romneys, 30/11/11, conversation with David Brooks)

**34:** I guess now there’s no chance anybody will ask Romney about the day he
drove to Canada with the family dog strapped to the roof of the car.
(Counting Really Small Blessings, 23/11/11)

**33:** There are a lot of mysteries in the Mitt saga. For instance, if you
were a very wealthy father of five energetic young boys, would you
choose to spend your vacation driving the whole family to Canada with
the dog strapped to the roof of the car? Wouldn’t it be more fun to
take a plane to Disneyland?
(Republican Financial Plans, 18/11/11)

**32:** The antipathy toward Mitt Romney is the most fascinating part of a
deeply fascinating political season. What is it about this guy? Is it
just because he once drove to Canada with the family dog strapped to
the roof of the car?
(Guess What It's Time For!, 11/11/11)

**31:** Pity the Republican voters. They aren’t asking for much. They just
want a candidate who’s really conservative but not totally crazy. Who
has verbs in his sentences. Who didn’t drive to Canada with the family
dog strapped to the roof of the car.
(Wait! Don't Tell Me!, 9/11/11)

**30:** Oh, wow! Rick Perry hit Mitt Romney with the illegal immigrant
landscapers! [...] I found this very exciting because it brings us
closer to the moment when one of Romney’s competitors will point out
that he once drove to Canada with the family dog strapped on the roof
of the car.
(Mitt and Begonia-gate, 19/10/11)

**29:** As things stand, the Perry camp is apparently planning to keep their
guy in the background during debates and hit Romney over the head with
mean commercials. That shouldn’t be too hard. Maybe they’ll include
the day Mitt drove to Canada with the family dog on the car roof.
(The Gift of Glib, 12/10/11)

**28:** I cannot really figure out that many ways to mention that Romney once
drove to Canada with the family dog strapped to the roof of the car.
(Desparately Seeking Dalrymple, 5/10/11)

**27:** Do you think Mitt Romney has created the bad karma that was
responsible for the total collapse of the Boston Red Sox? Do you think
that if he’s elected president, no blue-state team will ever win the
World Series again? Do you think his favorite sport is really
baseball, or maybe luge racing? Is there a way to work the fact that
he drove to Canada with the family dog strapped on the roof of the car
into this story?
(The Curse of the Mitt, 30/9/11)

**26:** I was wondering where I could fit in the dog on the roof.
(Is This Man the G.O.P.’s Best Bet for 2012?, 28/9/11, conversation with David Brooks)

**25:** I don’t want to believe I live in a country that would seriously
consider bestowing the nation’s highest office on a man who once drove
to Canada with the family dog strapped to the roof of the car.
(Perry's Bad Night, 23/9/11)

**24:** I admire the way Barack Obama has raised a dog in the White House
without ever putting it on the roof of the car for a vacation drive.
(Politicians, Love ’Em or Hate ’Em, 21/9/11)

**23:** Perry's puppy-rescue is a stirring picture, especially considering
that Perry’s chief competitor is the man who drove to Canada with the
family dog Seamus strapped to the roof of the car.
(Debating With the Stars, 7/9/11)

**22:** Try to imagine the Republican convention being asked to choose between
Mitt Romney, who once drove to Canada with the family dog strapped to
the roof of his car, and the guy who shot a puppy-eating coyote. With
a Ruger .380 with laser sights!
(The Coyote Candidate, 27/5/11)

**21:** What is it that everybody hates so much about [Mitt Romney]? That he
pioneered the Obama health care reform plan in Massachusetts and now
denies it? That he’s ardently anti-abortion after having run for
governor vowing endlessly to protect abortion rights? That he drove to
Canada with the family dog strapped on the roof of his car?
(And the G.O.P. Candidates Are …, 10/5/11, conversation with David Brooks)

**20:** Match the Republican presidential hopefuls: [...]  
2) Mitt Romney [...]  
C) Latest book fails to mention that he once drove to Canada with the
family dog strapped to the roof of the car. [...]  
(The Spring Quiz, 6/5/11)

**19:** There is not a single mention in “No Apology” of the fact that Romney
once drove to Canada with the family Irish setter strapped to the roof
of the car. I regard this as a critical oversight, although perhaps it
was Seamus that Romney was thinking of when he chose his title.
(Mitt! Mitt! Mitt!, 15/4/11)

**18:** Perhaps I should point out that Romney was named after J. Willard
Marriott, the hotel guy. And that he once drove to Canada with the
family dog strapped to the roof of the car.
(What's in a Nickname?, 25/3/11)

**17:** Match Republican presidential hopefuls with their 2010 achievements.
[...]  
5. Mitt Romney [...]  
C) Continued to fail to explain why he 
drove to Canada with the family dog strapped to the roof of the car.
[...]  
(The End-of-the-Year Quiz, 31/12/10)

**16:** I hope somebody out there is thinking about a tasteful Mitt Romney
Christmas ornament, perhaps showing Mitt’s family vacation to Canada,
with Seamus the dog strapped in his cage on the roof.
(The Gingrich Who Stole Christmas, 17/12/10)

**15:** I need to apologize to Mitt Romney. Here I was thinking of him as a
failed politician with no discernible core values, who had once driven
to Canada with the family dog strapped to the roof of the car.
(Mitt Romney, Liberal Icon, 31/3/10)

**14:** Romney’s real big news moment this week occurred when he had an
altercation with an unidentified passenger on a flight back from the
Winter Olympics. [...] And my sorrow in discovering that the fight did
not involve retribution for the day Romney drove his dog to Canada
strapped to the roof of the family car was ameliorated by my joy at
the vision of Mitt having an argument with a rapper about proper seat
positioning for takeoff.
(The Wages of Rages, 19/2/10)

**13:** Romney’s most dramatic recent moment came when he was attacked by a
fellow passenger on a flight home from the Olympics in Vancouver.
[...] Maybe he was an animal lover, still seething over the fact that
Romney once drove his family to Canada for a vacation with their Irish
setter, Seamus, strapped to the roof of the car.
(Time to Party Like It’s 1854, 18/2/10)

**12:** _Identify the speaker:_ “You’re a punk! You’re a dog! You always were a
dog your whole life, you punk dog.”  
a) Mitt Romney to Seamus, the
Irish setter he strapped on the roof of the car during a family trip
to Canada. [...]  
(The Year-End Quiz, 1/1/10)

**11:** Mitt Romney ran against Ted Kennedy for the Senate during one of
Kennedy’s particularly unslender periods. The Romney camp ran film of
Kennedy struggling to squeeze behind a table. [...] Of course, Kennedy
cleaned his clock. This is my second-favorite Mitt Romney story. I
couldn’t figure out any way to bring up the one about him driving to
Canada with the family dog strapped to the car roof.
(The Eye of the Beholder, 9/10/09)

**10:** I have to admit there’s something about Mitt that I find really
creepy, even when I’m not dwelling on that time he drove to Canada
with the family dog strapped on the roof.
(The Good, the Bad, the Ugly, 1/7/09, conversation with David Brooks)

**9:** Unlike Joe Lieberman, Palin is a member of the same party as the
presidential candidate. And unlike Mitt Romney, she has never gone on
vacation with the family dog strapped to the roof of the car.
(McCain's Baked Alaska, 19/3/09)

**8:** Match the presidential candidates: [...]  
4) Mitt Romney [...]  
E) Drove
to Canada with the family dog strapped on the roof of the car. [...]  
(The Year-End Quiz, 3/1/09)

**7:** I miss Mitt Romney. Sure, he was sort of smarmy. But when Mitt was
around, the banks had money and Iceland was solvent. And, of course,
when we got bored, we could always talk about how he drove to Canada
with his Irish setter strapped to the car roof.
(Dear Old Golden Dog Days, 10/10/08)

**6:** Who are Barack Obama and John McCain going to choose for their running
mates? I’m praying that McCain selects Mitt Romney so I can repeatedly
revisit the time Mitt drove to Canada with the family dog on the
station-wagon roof.
(Vice is Nice, 21/6/08)

**5:** Do you miss the primaries yet? Personally, I was happiest when the
field was crowded and, if all else failed, you could always whip up
something about Dennis Kucinich or Mitt Romney’s dog.
(Primary Days of Yore, 5/6/08, conversation with David Brooks)

**4:** I’m going to have to get through the rest of the year without ever
again referring to the fact that Romney once drove to Canada with the
family dog, Seamus, strapped to the roof of the car.
(The Revenge of Seamus, 9/2/08)

**3:** Romney has no known vices, except packing the family dog on top 
of the
car during long trips.
(Presidential Shopping List, 22/11/07)

**2:** 1. _When Mitt Romney’s son revealed that his dad once drove to Canada
with Seamus, the Irish setter, stuck in a crate on the car roof, the
Republican presidential candidate explained that he did it because
Seamus:_  
A) Was asking for it.  
B) Loves fresh air.  
C) Has bad breath.  
[...]  
4. _According to The Boston Globe, near the end of Mitt Romney’s
race for governor in 2002, his campaign ran an ad that was so
unpopular it almost cost him the election. The ad was:_   
A) An
endorsement by Seamus.  
[...]  
15. _Norman Hsu is: [...]_  
C) Little-known
blogger who broke the Seamus scandal online.  
(The Campaign-So-Far Quiz, 13/10/07)

**1:** Every time I see [Mitt Romney], all I can think about is Seamus the dog.
Seamus, in case you missed the story, was the Romneys' Irish setter
back in the early 1980s. Mitt used to drive the family from Boston to
Ontario every summer for a vacation, with the dog strapped to the roof
in a crate. As The Boston Globe reported this summer, Romney had the
entire trip planned so rigidly that every gas station stop was
predetermined before departure. During the fatal trip of '83, Seamus
apparently needed one more than the schedule allowed. When evidence of
the setter's incontinence came running down the back windshield,
Romney abandoned his itinerary and drove to the closest gas station,
where he got a hose and sprayed both dog and station wagon clean.
[...] Romney has already come under considerable fire from animal
rights groups over the Seamus incident. "They're not happy that my dog
loves fresh air," Romney snapped back. He said that just recently, in
Pittsburgh, although Seamus had actually long since shuffled off this
mortal coil. Is it possible that Romney is trying to dodge the
Republican YouTube debate because he's afraid someone will ask him
about his method of transporting dogs across long distances?
(Haunted by Seamus, 4/8/07)
