Here are two things I enjoy:

First is Felicity Cloake’s [“How to cook the perfect…”](https://www.theguardian.com/food/series/how-to-cook-the-perfect----) series in the *Guardian*. Cloake goes through multiple different recipes for something, rigorously testing them out and selecting the best bits from each, doing the sort of research and refinement that one senses most recipe book writers don’t actually bother to do. Plus, it’s matched with genuine sense of fun and a bouncy prose style that often evades the American science-nerd food-hack bros with which the series shares some superficial similarities.

Second is the journalistic concept of the “elegant variation” or the “second mention”. This is when, after introducing some person, place or object, the writer the later replaces the straightforward noun by a more complicated description. Take [this example](https://www.independent.co.uk/travel/news-and-advice/venice-tourist-tax-fees-italy-overtourism-b2409844.html) from the *Independent* a few days ago:

> Day-trippers visiting Venice will be charged €5 to enter the historic centre from next year under long-awaited plans to tackle overtourism in the Italian city that finally look set to be adopted. A ticketing system will also be introduced to limit the numbers pouring into the famous canal-strewn tourist hotspot.

Here, “Venice” gets called “the Italian city” on second reference, then “the famous canal-strewn tourist hotspot” on the third. This can be done for various reasons: to concisely introduce extra information, to avoid awkward repetition, as a sort of journo insider joke, or just as plain bad writing. I enjoy the Twitter accounts [@secondmentions](https://twitter.com/secondmentions) and [@knobblymonsters](https://twitter.com/knobblymonsters) that collect some of the best examples – [see my own submissions here](https://twitter.com/search?q=from%3Ampaldridge%20secondmentions&f=live). (“Knobbly monsters” are another name for these, being itself, of course, an elegant variation on “crocodiles” – other names are “elongated yellow fruits” or “popular orange vegetables”, after … well, you can work it out.)

But in an exciting collision of my interests, whoever writes the subheads for the “How to cook the perfect…” series is quite the connoisseur of the second mention too. Here are some of my favourites. (If you like, turn this into a quiz by guessing what food the second mention is referring to, before checking the link to see if you’re right.)
