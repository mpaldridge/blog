title: MA40042 Measure Theory and Integration

This page is for the module **MA40042 Measure Theory and Integration** as taught at the University of Bath in 2016–17. I have no idea what relation it bears to any currently taught material.

The module is split into two parts:

*   **Measure theory** is the first part of the course, is lectured by me, and lasts five weeks;
*   **Integration** is the second part of the course, will be lectured by [Dr Matt Roberts](http://people.bath.ac.uk/mir20/), and will last six weeks.

This page is for the measure theory part of the course only.

## Books

The lectures should cover all necessary material for the course. However, it may be helpful to consult a textbook for further information or a different view of the material.

I have found the following books useful:

*   D Williams, _Probability with Martingales_, Cambridge University Press, 1991. \[Chapters 1 and A1\]
*   T Lindstrøm, _Mathematical Analysis_. [Available online](http://www.uio.no/studier/emner/matnat/math/MAT2400/v14/) \[Chapters 5 and 6\]

I really liked Lindstrøm, and you will notice many similarities to the lecture notes. Williams takes a more probabilistic view of material, which some may prefer.

I haven’t used them much myself, but hear good things about:

*   P Billingsley, _Probability and Measure_, anniversary edition, Wiley, 2012. \[Chapters 1 and 2\]
*   R Durrett, _Probability: Theory and examples_, fourth edition, Cambridge University Press, 2010. \[Chapter 1 and Appendix A\]
*   W Rudin, _Real and Complex Analysis_, third edition, McGraw-Hill, 1987. \[Chapters 1 and 2\]

All these books cover relevant material for the Integration part of the course also.
