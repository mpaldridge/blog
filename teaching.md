## Current teaching

### MATH5825M Independent Learning and Skills Project

In 2024–25, Semester 1, I am the module leader for **MATH5835M Statistical Computing**. More to appear soon.

### OMAT5203 Statistical Computing

I am designing the module OMAT5203 Statistical Computing for the online programme [MSc Data Science (Statistics)](https://www.coursera.org/degrees/msc-data-science-ul), which runs on the [Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/degrees/msc-data-science-ul) platform. It will run for the first time in early 2025.

### MATH5825M Independent Learning and Skills Project

In 2024–25, Semester 2, I am the module leader for MATH5825M Independent Learning and Skills Project. Material for this module is on Minerva.

### Other things

* MATH2900 Maths at Work: I advise a project on "Statistics in the media".
* MATH3001 Project in Mathematics: I advise a project on "Data compression"
* MATH5971M/MATH5872M Dissertation in Statisitcs / Data Science and Analytics: I advise various projects, including "Statistics, politics, law, and gerrymandering", "Pooled testing for Covid-19", and "MRP: Multilevel regression with post-stratification".

## Past teaching

### [MATH1710 Probability & Statistics I](https://mpaldridge.github.io/math1710/)

From 2021–22 to 2023–24, I lectured the module **[MATH1710 Probability and Statistics I](https://mpaldridge.github.io/math1710/)**. The main website for this module was [here](https://mpaldridge.github.io/math1710/). This site is quite similar, but not identical, to how the first half of the current MATH1700 Probability and Statistics is taught.

### [MATH2750 Introduction to Markov Processes](https://mpaldridge.github.io/math2750/)

From 2018-19 to 2020-21, I lectured the module **[MATH2750 Introduction to Markov Processes](https://mpaldridge.github.io/math2750/)**. The main website for this module was [here](https://mpaldridge.github.io/math2750/). This site closely, but not perfectly, represents the module as it is currently taught.

### MATH3015 History of Mathematics

In 2019-20, I lectured one third of [MATH3015 History of Mathematics](./math3015/), on History of Statistics, with Dr Phil Walker and Dr Nicola Gambino. Some material is available [here](./math3015/). I'm not sure how closely this represents the module as it is currently taught.

### MA40042 Measure Theory and Integration (Bath)

In 2016-17 at the University of Bath, I lectured one half of [MA40042 Measure Theory and Integration](./ma40042/), on Measure Theory, with Dr Matt Roberts. Some material is available [here](./ma40042/). I don't know if or in what form this module still exists.

### MATH30002/MATHM0009 Topics in Discrete Mathematics (Bristol)

In 2013-14 at the University of Bristol, I lectured one third of of [MATH30002/MATHM0009 Topics in Discrete Mathematics](./math30002/), on Introduction to Graph Theory, with Dr Jonathan Bober and Dr Karen Gunderson. Some material is available [here](./math30002/). If this module still exists then it now covers entirely different topics.

## Other

### R Markdown

I have [some notes on using R Markdown and Bookdown](../rmarkdown-draft/). The intended audience is people (particularly people in the School of Mathematics at the University of Leeds) wanting to write accessible online lecture notes. It's somewhat out of date.
