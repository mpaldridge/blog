In my lecture yesterday afternoon we were dealing the axiomatic approach to probability. That is, we start solely from the [three axioms of probability](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Probability_axioms#Axioms), and use those rules to prove various properties. I was explaining to my students that usually the way to solve such problems is to look for a way to write things as disjoint unions -- because once you have a disjoint union, you can use the third and most powerful axiom, which says that if $A_1, A_2, \dots$ is a finite or countably infinite sequence of disjoint events, then

$$ \mathbb P(A_1 \cup A_2 \cup \cdots) = \mathbb P(A_1) + \mathbb P(A_2) + \cdots . $$

In particular, this means that if two events $A$ and $B$ are disjoint, then we have

$$ \mathbb P(A \cup B) = \mathbb P(A) + \mathbb P(B) . $$

But what if $A$ and $B$ are not disjoint. Then we have the *addition rule for unions*:

$$ \mathbb P(A \cup B) = \mathbb P(A) + \mathbb P(B) - \mathbb P(A \cap B). $$

I pointed out to my students that when they saw this result at school they probably said "Well, $\mathbb P(A \cup B)$ is $\mathbb P(A)$ and $\mathbb P(B)$ together, but we've counted the overlap twice, so we have to subtract it" -- but that's not a formal proof based just on the three axioms. So what is a formal proof?

Here's two proofs. This is not a difficult result to prove, and these two proofs are basically the same, really, but they're presentationally a bit different.

### Proof 1

**PROOF 1.** The problem is that $A \cup B$ is not a disjoint union, so we can't use Axiom 3 on it. But we can have $A \cup B = A \cup \{\text{something}\}$ as a disjoint union -- and that something must be $B \cap A^{\mathsf c}$, the bit of $B$ that doesn't overlap with $A$.

So applying Axiom 3 to the disjoint union on the right-hand side of 

$$ A \cup B = A \cup (B \cap A^{\mathsf c}) $$

gives

$$ \mathbb P(A \cup B) = \mathbb P(A) + \mathbb P(B \cap A^{\mathsf c}) . \tag{1.1} $$

But that $\mathbb P(B \cap A^{\mathsf c})$ doesn't appear in the theorem, so we'll need to find a different disjoint union containing that, to let us eliminate it. The only real choice is

$$ (B \cap A^{\mathsf c}) \cup (A \cap B) = B . $$

Applying Axiom 3 gives

$$ \mathbb P(B \cap A^{\mathsf c}) + \mathbb P(A \cap B) = \mathbb P(B) , $$

rearranging gives

$$ \mathbb P(B \cap A^{\mathsf c}) = \mathbb P(B) - \mathbb P(A \cap B) , \tag{1.2} $$

and substituting $(1.2)$ into $(1.1)$ gives the result. QED.

### Proof 2

**PROOF 2.** Our problem is that $A$ and $B$ are not disjoint sets, so we can't apply Axiom 3. Instead lets split everything up into the three disjoint bits $A \cap B^\mathsf{c}$, $A \cap B$ and $B \cap A^{\mathsf c}$.

PICTURE

In terms of these three disjoint bits, we now have

$$ \begin{align}
A &= (A \cap B^\mathsf{c}) \cup (A \cap B) \\
B &= (B \cap A^\mathsf{c}) \cup (A \cap B) \\
A \cup B &= (A \cap B^\mathsf{c}) \cup (B \cap A^\mathsf{c}) \cup (A \cap B),
\end{align} $$

with all the unions on the right-hand side being disjoint. Applying Axiom 3 to them all gives

$$ \begin{align}
\mathbb P(A) &= \mathbb P(A \cap B^\mathsf{c}) + \mathbb P(A \cap B) \tag{2.1} \\
\mathbb P(B) &= \mathbb P(B \cap A^\mathsf{c}) + \mathbb P(A \cap B) \tag{2.2} \\
\mathbb P(A \cup B) &= \mathbb P(A \cap B^\mathsf{c}) + \mathbb P(B \cap A^\mathsf{c}) + \mathbb P(A \cap B) . \tag{2.3} 
\end{align} $$

At this stage there are a few slightly different -- and I mean *very slightly* different -- ways of finishing this off.

**Sub-proof 2a.** Here, $(2.3)$ is getting close to the result, but we don't want the awkward $\mathbb P(A \cap B^\mathsf{c})$ and $\mathbb P(B \cap A^\mathsf{c})$ terms. Rearranging $(2.1)$ and $(2.2)$ gives

$$ \begin{align}
\mathbb P(A \cap B^\mathsf{c}) &=  \mathbb P(A) - \mathbb P(A \cap B) \\
\mathbb P(B \cap A^\mathsf{c}) &=  \mathbb P(B) - \mathbb P(A \cap B) ,
\end{align} $$

and substituting these into $(2.3)$ gives the result. QED.

**Sub-proof 2b.** From $(2.1)$ and $(2.2)$, we have

$$ \begin{align}
\mathbb P(A) + \mathbb P(B) 
  &= \mathbb P(A \cap B^\mathsf{c}) + \mathbb P(A \cap B) + \mathbb P(B \cap A^\mathsf{c}) + \mathbb P(A \cap B) \\
  &= \mathbb P(A \cup B) + \mathbb P(A \cap B) ,
\end{align} $$

where the second equality is by $(2.3)$. Rearranging gives the result. QED.

**Sub-proof 2c.** By substituting in $(2.1)$ and $(2.2)$, the right-hand side of the desired result is

$$ \begin{align}
&\mathbb P(A) + \mathbb P(B) - \mathbb P(A \cap B) \\
  &\qquad\qquad = \mathbb P(A \cap B^\mathsf{c}) + \mathbb P(A \cap B + \mathbb P(B \cap A^\mathsf{c}) + \mathbb P(A \cap B) - \mathbb P(A \cap B) \\
  &\qquad\qquad = \mathbb P(A \cap B^\mathsf{c}) + \mathbb P(B \cap A^\mathsf{c}) + \mathbb P(A \cap B) ,
\end{align} $$

which, by $(2.3)$, is indeed $\mathbb P(A \cup B)$. QED.

### Which is best?

Looking through some textbooks and lecture notes I have been consulting when writing my notes, I see that:

* Grimmett and Walsh's book uses Proof 2b.
* A discussion after the main proof in Ross's book uses Proof 2a.
* Blitzstein and Hwang's book, Scheaffer and Young's book, Stirzaker's book, the main proof in Ross's book, [Oliver Johnson's lecture notes](https://people.maths.bris.ac.uk/~maotj/teaching.html), [Richard Weber's lecture notes](http://www.statslab.cam.ac.uk/~rrw1/prob/index.html), the lecture notes of the previous (and previous to that) lecturer of my course, and me last year all use Proof 1.

So it seems that Proof 1 is the most popular. But I like Proof 2 best.
