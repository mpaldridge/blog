**[The Untold Story of the World's Biggest Diamond Heist](https://www.wired.com/2009/03/ff-diamonds-2/)  
Joshua Davis, _Wired_**  
"'I may be a thief and a liar,' he says in beguiling Italian-accented French. 'But I am going to tell you a true story.'"

**[Over Detroit Skies](https://www.huffpost.com/entry/over-detroit-skies_b_404255)  
Roey Rosenblith, _Huffington Post_**  
"I was on my third in-flight movie when the screaming started, shattering my tired half-awake travel state. I had gone from watching _Up_ to _Inglorious Basterds_ and had decided to try rounding things off with _Land of the Lost_. That was when my fellow passenger Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab decided to ignite his explosives 19 rows ahead of me."

**[How David Beats Goliath](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2009/05/11/how-david-beats-goliath)  
Malcolm Gladwell, _The New Yorker_**  
"David’s victory over Goliath, in the Biblical account, is held to be an anomaly. It was not. Davids win all the time."

**[Fatal Distraction](https://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/magazine/fatal-distraction-forgetting-a-child-in-thebackseat-of-a-car-is-a-horrifying-mistake-is-it-a-crime/2014/06/16/8ae0fe3a-f580-11e3-a3a5-42be35962a52_story.html)  
Gene Weingarten, _Washington Post_**  
"'Death by hyperthermia' is the official designation. When it happens to young children, the facts are often the same: An otherwise loving and attentive parent one day gets busy, or distracted, or upset, or confused by a change in his or her daily routine, and just... forgets a child is in the car."

**[The Deepest Dive](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2009/08/24/the-deepest-dive)  
Alec Wilkinson, _The New Yorker_**  
"Meanwhile, the lungs compress, halving themselves after ten metres, ther reducing by degrees until, by a hundred metres, they are something like the size of a fist; free diving is the only sport in which the lungs shrink and the heart slows."

**[Trial By Fire](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2009/09/07/trial-by-fire)  
David Grann, _The New Yorker_**  
"There is a chance, however, that Texas could become the first state to acknowledge officially that, since the advent of the modern judicial system, it had carried out the 'execution of a legally and factually innocent person.'"

**[The Murder of Leo Tolstoy](https://harpers.org/archive/2009/02/the-murder-of-leo-tolstoy/)  
Elif Batuman, _Harper's_**  
"After his religious rebirth in 1881, Tolstoy changed his practice of ending each diary entry with a plan for the next day, replacing it with the phrase 'if I am alive.' It occurred to me that ever since 1881 Tolstoy had _always known he would be murdered_."

**[How I Convinced a Death-Row Murderer Not to Die](https://www.esquire.com/news-politics/a6836/christian-longo-0110/)**  
**Michael Finkel, _Esquire_**  
"He asked if I'd be willing to help him formulate a plan to donate his body parts. I said, once I wrapped my mind around the idea, that it was something I could do, but first I needed to clear my conscience. If I was going to help him die, I had to hear the full story of the night his family was killed."

**[The Devil at 37,000 Feet](https://www.vanityfair.com/culture/2009/01/air_crash200901)  
William Langewiesche, _Vanity Fair_**  
"What were the odds? There were so many chances for the accident not to occur—so many ways to break the chain that led to it—that a crash investigator later told me it seemed the Devil himself was at play. "

**[Don't!](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2009/05/18/dont-2)  
Jonah Lehrer, _The New Yorker_**  
"Some cover their eyes with their hands or turn around so that they can’t see the tray. Others start kicking the desk, or tug on their pigtails, or stroke the marshmallow as if it were a tiny stuffed animal."

**[Eight Days](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2009/09/21/eight-days)  
James B. Stewart, _The New Yorker_**  
"The most important week in American financial history since the Great Depression began at 8 A.M. on a Friday in the middle of September last year."

**[The Deadly Choices at Memorial](https://www.propublica.org/article/the-deadly-choices-at-memorial-826)**  
**Sheri Fink, _ProPublica_ and _The New York Times_**  
"The smell of death was overpowering the moment a relief worker cracked open one of the hospital chapel’s wooden doors. Inside, more than a dozen bodies lay motionless on low cots and on the ground, shrouded in white sheets."

**[Writer Evan Ratliff Tried to Vanish: Here’s What Happened](https://www.wired.com/2009/11/ff-vanish2/)**  
**Evan Ratliff, _Wired_**  
"The premise is simple: I will try to vanish for a month and start over under a new identity. _Wired_ readers, or whoever else happens upon the chase, will try to find me."
