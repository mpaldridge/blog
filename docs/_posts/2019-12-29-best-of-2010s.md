### Top 10 films

![](../assets/img/2010s-melancholia.jpg)

**The Act of Killing** (Joshua Oppenheimer)  
You wonder if, with it's artistic approach, the film is letting the perpatrators off easily, but then the final scene back on the rooftop is astonishing.

**Call Me By Your Name** (Luca Guadagnino)  
Would make the list on the strength of the Michael Stuhlbarg speech alone.

**Carol** (Todd Haynes)  
The best Christmas film of all time.

**For Sama** / من أجل سما (Waad Al-Kateab & Edward Watts)  
It's horrific and upsetting, but also a deeply, profoundly optimistic film.

**Four Lions** (Christopher Morris)  
A geniune comedic tragedy. The best thing Chris Morris has done.

**her** (Spike Jonze)  
Is it weird to say this has the best sex scene in film if one of the two people doesn't even exist?

**Melancholia** (Lars von Trier)  
Is it a film about depression, or is it just a film about the Earth being hit by a big planet?

**Phantom Thread** (Paul Thomas Anderson)  
The decade's lushest costume drama, swooniest romance, most giffable comedy, scariest ghost story, most twisted psychological thriller, and best film.

**Tower** (Keith Maitland)  
It's a careful and thoughtful documentary, but also a beautiful art film, and also a nail-biting thriller.

I regret not being able to include: *Beast*, *Black Swan*, *Cold War*, *First Reformed*, *The Grand Budapest Hotel*, *Lady Bird*, *Lady Macbeth*, *The Lobster*, *Marriage Story*, *The Social Network*.

Plus: if *Apocalypse Now: The Final Cut* counts as a new film, then it's top of the list.

### Top 10 albums

**Atoms for Peace – Amok**  
Thom Yorke's solo work and side-projects are really, really good, and even the hardcore Radiohead under-appreciate them.

**Björk – Vulnicura**  
On the list on the basis of the first half, which is one of the all-time great half-albums.

**Bonobo – Black Sands**  
This is great, but it was perhaps even better live, where the brass and wind played a more forward role.

**Kate Bush – 50 Words for Snow**  
Among her many dazzling talents, Kate Bush remains an underrated pianist.

**Camille – Ilo Veyou**  
Quiet and delicate, but lovely.

**PJ Harvey – Let England Shake**  
It might not quite have her best songs, but this is PJ Harvey's most complete artistic statement.

**Metronomy – The English Riviera**  
My housemate was always a fan of this, but I never really got it until, years later, a cafe I was working in played the whole album front-to-back, and then it seemed obviously brilliant.

**Kanye West – My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy**  
The crowning masterpiece of Kanye's genius period.

**Kanye West – Yeezus**  
The best album there has been – and, it increasingly seems, that there ever will be – in Kanye's post-genius period.

The first nine on the list were easy to pick, but it's difficult to decide on the tenth. For my joker pick I'll either go for **Dirty Projectors – Dirty Projectors** and **Amber Coffman – City of No Reply** considered as a conceptual double-album about both sides of a breakup, or the **Hamilton** soundtrack.
