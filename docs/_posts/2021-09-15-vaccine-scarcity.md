"The unit cost of these vaccines is not high. It’s maybe too high for the poorest countries on Earth. But a lot of middle-income countries that could easily afford \$20 a shot for people just don’t _have_ them, because that number of vaccines doesn’t exist. And Pfizer are not _refusing_ -- they’re selling at a profit; but this is all that they can make. What we don’t have a policy focus on is: _Why_ is it all that they can make, exactly? […]

"I feel like we have not had from the government (and journalists – but really the government) is real feet-to-the-fire 'What’s up here, guys?' stuff. 'Why don’t you do this? Why do you think that the amount that you’re producing now is profitable, but that the investments you would need to make to increase it dramatically wouldn’t be profitable?'

"And I can think of a lot of reasons: whenever you ask this on Twitter, people come up with speculation that makes a certain amount of sense. But I want to hear it from the CEO. And the answer could be 'OK, to increase production we would need to wipe out the entire population of elephants worldwide,' and we’d say, 'Ugh, I don’t know about that.' But it could just be 'Well, we would need to raise the unit cost to \$45 a dose, and we don’t want you to yell at us about price gouging,' and then we should think about it and be like, 'Well, raising the unit cost to \$45 a dose: Would that be so bad? Maybe we shouldn’t yell at them about price gouging.' Maybe they need more glass to be diverted from something else; they need a federal order saying we’re not going to make any new TVs for some period of time. Who knows?

"But that was wartime mobilisation: you identify actually what are the bottlenecks and then you try to resolve them, instead of just saying, 'Well, we are where we are,' and we have to deal with this scarcity."
