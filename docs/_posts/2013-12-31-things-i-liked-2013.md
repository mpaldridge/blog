**[A profile of Apollo Robbins](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2013/01/07/a-pickpockets-tale)**, possibly the greatest pickpocket in the world. (The opening feels like a nod to Mark Singer's opening to his [famous profile of Ricky Jay](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/1993/04/05/secrets-of-the-magus). Also, don't miss [the accompanying video](https://www.newyorker.com/video/watch/apollo-robbins-tricks-of-the-trade).)

[**What happens** when Lindsay Lohan, Brett Easton Ellis, Paul Schrader, and James Deen (the pornstar, not the other one) try to make a film together?](https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/13/magazine/here-is-what-happens-when-you-cast-lindsay-lohan-in-your-movie.html)


MUSIC: Best albums: **Yeezus** was impressive for how much effort it went to to actively piss off its audience, and was also great. ([Here](http://www.slate.com/articles/arts/music_box/2013/06/kanye_west_s_yeezus_reviewed.html)'s Carl Wilson; [here](http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2013/06/24/black-noise)'s SFJ.) My favourite album of the year, though, was the underrated **Amok** by Atoms for Peace. \| Best singles: Arctic Monkeys (*above*; the album is good too), Sleigh Bells, Bonobo feat Erykah Badu. \| Best EP: [**FKA twigs**](https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18590-twigs-ep2/) \| Best live version of a song already mentioned on this list: [**Amok** by Atoms for Peace](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cP3iKrMDE-g) (I'm not sure if I'm in the audience of that video, or whether it's from the other night) \| Best remix of a David Bowie song inspired by Steve Reich's "Clapping Music": \| Best unreleased cover of Jennifer Paige's Crush: [Jai Paul](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvHYFl0kqIk) [Twigs EP2?? Amok live?? Bowie remix??

[**Thanksgiving in Mongolia**](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2013/11/18/thanksgiving-in-mongolia) by Ariel Levy. This is beautiful and heartbreaking and I hope it's not insensitive to say it's also sometimes like a horror film. (Also: [Levy profiles Edith Windsor](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2013/09/30/the-perfect-wife).)

An all-time great [#Slatepitch](https://slate.com/culture/2009/10/the-slate-pitch-twitter-meme.html): **[Inside - better than outside](https://slate.com/business/2013/08/eating-lunch-outside-sucks-stay-inside.html)**

OLD THINGS I CAME ACROSS THIS YEAR: Nina Simone's 1958 debut album **Little Girl Blue** is her most straightforwardly jazz album -- but my favourite moment is [the piano solo in "Love Me or Leave Me" (at 0:52)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uId47pfkAaE) which sounds more like Bach than jazz. \| I spent one sunny weekend this summer inside reading two novellas, and they'd both very high on a list of the greatest fiction I've ever read: **Chronicle of a Death Foretold** by Gabriel García Márquez and **The Outsider** (aka *The Stranger*) by Albert Camus \| **The films of Alfred Hitchcock**: The Birds and Rear Window are masterpieces; North by Northwest the best fun one; The Lady Vanishes is terrific and underrated; I haven't seen Psycho yet \| [Old **Slate Audio Booksclubs**](http://www.slate.com/articles/arts/the_audio_book_club.4.html) -- by "old" I mean sort of 2006--2009, when Stephen Metcalf, Katie Roiphe, and Megan O'Rourke were common panellists; maybe start with [Philip Roth’s Everyman](http://www.slate.com/articles/arts/the_audio_book_club/2006/06/slates_audio_book_club.html) \| Joan Didion’s essays **"Slouching Towards Bethlehem"** and **"On self-respect"**.

FILMS: **The Act of Killing** is extraordinary -- the penultimate scene where Anwar Congo returns to the rooftop will stay with me for a long time. I am not embarassed to say I loved **Gravity**. **Before Midnight** completes the best film trilogy ever made. **Enough Said** makes me sad James Gandolfini didn't get to make more romantic comedies.

PODCASTS: **This American Life** [at Harper High School (part 1, part 2) and] at a car showroom \| The **Slate Culture Gabfest** is always good, but the discussion of Dana's anti-flipflops piece may be the Gabfestiest moment since the infamous granola-off \| Natasha Vargas-Cooper on the **Longform podcast** \| **Radiolab**: Speed \| Stephen Fry on **RHLSTP** (RHLSTP!)

**Interlude for listicles:** [Martin Amis Character or "Tatler" Byline from Feb. 2013?](https://www.thehairpin.com/2013/02/martin-amis-character-or-tatler-byline-from-feb-2013/) \| [Arguments against gay marriage](https://www.mcsweeneys.net/articles/arguments-against-gay-marriage) \| [A Slideshow Of Different Animals Who Are Not Friends And Have Never Met](https://the-toast.net/2013/12/02/animals-who-are-not-friends/)

SPORT: Stage 6 of the Vuelta a España -- Tony Martin went on a 175km breakway lasting four hours; I can only find [a video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BZNgFiovZgk) of the last two minutes of it.

*Behind the blogpost*: OK, I admit that it's actually 2022 when I write, and I'm trying reconstruct this list from an old partially-completed draft I found on an ex-laptop. The last item on the list is "Marmots eating biscuits", with no hyperlink, and I have no memory of what that was meant to refer to but perhaps it was this:
