Obamas photobomb

*What happens when Lindsay Lohan, Brett Easton Ellis, Paul Schrader, and James Deen (the pornstar, not the other one) try to make a film together?

*Ariel Levy's Thanksgiving in Mongolia is brilliant and heartbreaking (with a strong undercurrent of body horror)

*An all-time great #Slatepitch: Inside - better than outside

MUSIC: Best albums: **Yeezus** was impressive for how much effort it went to to actively piss off its audience, and was also great. ([Here](http://www.slate.com/articles/arts/music_box/2013/06/kanye_west_s_yeezus_reviewed.html)'s Carl Wilson; [here](http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2013/06/24/black-noise)'s SFJ.) My favourite album of the year, though, was the underrated **Amok** by Atoms for Peace. \| Best singles: Arctic Monkeys (*above*; the album is good too), Sleigh Bells, Bonobo feat Erykah Badu. Jai Paul's unreleased cover of Jennifer Paige's Crush. [Twigs EP2?? Amok live?? Bowie remix??]

OLD THINGS I CAME ACROSS THIS YEAR: Nina Simone's 1958 debut album **Little Girl Blue** is her most straightforwardly jazz album -- but my favourite moment is [the piano solo in "Love Me or Leave Me" (at 0:52)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uId47pfkAaE) which sounds more like Bach than jazz. \| I spent one sunny weekend this summer inside reading two novellas, and they'd both very high on a list of the greatest fiction I've ever read: **Chronicle of a Death Foretold** by Gabriel García Márquez and **The Outsider** (aka *The Stranger*) by Albert Camus \| **The films of Alfred Hitchcock**: The Birds and Rear Window are masterpieces; North by Northwest the best fun one; The Lady Vanishes is terrific and underrated; I haven't seen Psycho yet \| [Old **Slate Audio Booksclubs**](http://www.slate.com/articles/arts/the_audio_book_club.4.html) -- by "old" I mean sort of 2006--2009, when Stephen Metcalf, Katie Roiphe, and Megan O'Rourke were common panellists; maybe start with [Philip Roth’s Everyman](http://www.slate.com/articles/arts/the_audio_book_club/2006/06/slates_audio_book_club.html) \| Joan Didion’s essays **"Slouching Towards Bethlehem"** and **"On self-respect"**.

FILMS: **The Act of Killing** is extraordinary -- the penultimate scene where Anwar Congo returns to the rooftop will stay with me for a long time. I am not embarassed to say I loved **Gravity**. **Before Midnight** completes the best film trilogy ever made. **Enough Said** makes me sad James Gandolfini didn't get to make more romantic comedies.

PODCASTS: **This American Life** [at Harper High School (part 1, part 2) and] at a car showroom \| The **Slate Culture Gabfest** is always good, but the discussion of Dana's anti-flipflops piece may be the Gabfestiest moment since the infamous granola-off \| Natasha Vargas-Cooper on the **Longform podcast** \| **Radiolab**: Speed \| Stephen Fry on **RHLSTP** (RHLSTP!)

**Interlude for listicles:** [Martin Amis Character or "Tatler" Byline from Feb. 2013?](https://www.thehairpin.com/2013/02/martin-amis-character-or-tatler-byline-from-feb-2013/) \| [Arguments against gay marriage](https://www.mcsweeneys.net/articles/arguments-against-gay-marriage) \| [A Slideshow Of Different Animals Who Are Not Friends And Have Never Met](https://the-toast.net/2013/12/02/animals-who-are-not-friends/)
