[**Emily Gould on shame**](https://www.thecut.com/2020/02/emily-gould-gawker-shame.html)

[**Lauren Collins on losing her father** during a pandemic, while in another country](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2020/05/11/reinventing-grief-in-an-era-of-enforced-isolation)

[**Laura Barton on travelling to Greece for IVF** during a pandemic](https://www.theguardian.com/society/2020/may/16/i-flew-to-greece-and-began-solo-ivf-then-the-world-shut-down)

[A 12,000-word **essay/book review about Herbert Hoover**](https://slatestarcodex.com/2020/03/17/book-review-hoover/)

For Janet Malcolm fans, like me, the one thing we wish she'd write about is [the decade-long libel suit bought against by one of her journalistic subjects](https://www.encyclopedia.com/law/law-magazines/masson-v-malcolm-et-al-1993-1994). (Although we're slightly ashamed for wanting this – it's like hoping Radiohead will play Creep, or ordering the cheeseburger at a nice restaurant.) And now, twenty-five years later, [**she has**](https://www.nybooks.com/articles/2020/09/24/jeffrey-masson-trial-second-chance/)! Regardless of what you think of the merits of the case, this is such a good essay – I read it three times on the day it was published, and have read it at least three times since.

**[Oily bible](https://slate.com/human-interest/2020/02/oil-bible-dalton-georgia-trump-prophecy-evangelical-miracle.html)**

**[On allegations of sexual assault at a Cambridge college](https://www.tortoisemedia.com/2020/02/18/campus-justice-trinity-hall/)**

**[How apples go bad](https://www.newyorker.com/culture/annals-of-gastronomy/how-apples-go-bad)**

**[64 reasons to celebrate Paul McCartney](https://ianleslie.substack.com/p/64-reasons-to-celebrate-paul-mccartney)**

[The **Name of the Year** contest!](https://www.vulture.com/tags/name-of-the-year/)

[What someone who has never been to New York City or America **imagines her life will be like** when she moves there](https://www.the-fence.com/issues/issue-4/empire-state-of-mind)
