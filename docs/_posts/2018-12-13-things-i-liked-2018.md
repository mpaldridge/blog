**[The flowers that make Chanel No 5](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2018/03/19/fragrant-harvest)**

**[I pulled a 1,500-year-old sword out of a lake](https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2018/oct/19/experience-pulled-a-1500-year-old-sword-lake-saga-vanecek)** ("People on the internet are saying I am the queen of Sweden. I wouldn’t mind being queen for a day, but when I grow up I want to be a vet. Or an actor in Paris.")

FILMS: **Phantom Thread** was 2018's lushest costume drama, swooniest romance, most [giffable](https://giphy.com/phantomthread) comedy, most twisted psychological thriller, and best film. Other very good films this year, in approximate order: **Lady Bird** ("It's the titular role!"), **Beast**, **Cold War**, **First Reformed**, **A Fantastic Woman**, **Faces Places**, **Shoplifters** | The best thing about moving to Leeds so far was the **Leeds Internation Film Festival**; my favourites there were **Birds of Passage** (like if _The Godfather_ was set among the Wayuu people of north Colombia), **Shoplifters** again, **Colette** (underrated!), *All Is Well* ([now on Netflix](https://www.netflix.com/title/81030855) | The two best films I saw this year were the re-release of **2001: A Space Odyssey** (if we rank films purely on what _cinema_ can do that other art forms can't, this is perhaps the greatest film of all time) and the re-release of **Vertigo** (this was about my fourth or fifth time seeing it – first on the big screen – and I think I finally _got_ it). Plus I saw at the Watershed in Bristol (which I miss) **Do the Right Thing** and **The Battle of Algiers**, which are both excellent. | I went to the cinema 89 times this year, which I've calculated is roughly 1000% more times than I went last year. General endorsements: Go to the cinema more often. Sit one row closer to the screen than you think you want to. | It's not exactly a film, but I saw about four and a half hours of **The Clock** ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Clock_(2010_film)), [The New Yorker](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2012/03/12/the-hours-daniel-zalewski)) at the Tate Modern, and it's completely riveting in an unusual way | The most nail-biting short film of 2018 was this:

TV: My two favourite series were deliciously good fun on the outside and, in different ways, kind of clever and important on the inside: **Killing Eve** and **A Very English Scandal** | I would recommend **Stephen**, the terrific and harrowing documentary about Stephen Lawrence, his murder, and what came after, but I don't know any way to watch it legally | I know you thought **[Collateral](https://www.netflix.com/title/80185171)** was bad because it was preachy and obvious, and I don't really have a good counterargument, but I just liked it (although it's no State of Play) | **[Last Week Tonight](https://www.youtube.com/user/LastWeekTonight/videos)**

**[The White Darkness](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2018/02/12/the-white-darkness)** – David Grann writes about Henry Worsley's solo track across the Antarctic

**[Lauren Collins on the royal family](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2018/05/21/prince-harry-meghan-markle-and-royal-romance)** has more delightful sentences than anything else I read this year

In memoriam: **[Helen Rosner remembers Anthony Bourdain](https://www.newyorker.com/culture/annals-of-gastronomy/anthony-bourdain-and-the-power-of-telling-the-truth)** | **[Zadie Smith remembers Philip Roth](https://www.newyorker.com/books/page-turner/philip-roth-a-writer-all-the-way-down)**

MUSIC: Best album by a French singer-songwriter: **Chris** by Christine and the Queens or **Ne rien faire** by Pauline Croze. Best album not in this category: **2012–2017** by Against All Logic or **so sad so sexy** by Lykke Li as runners-up | Best singles: **[Nobody](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qooWnw5rEcI)** by Mitski and **[Noid](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FU65VaNeLeM)** by Yves Tumor | Best video/song which I feel bad about recommending because it's actually an advert: **Spike Jonze x FKA twigs x Anderson .Paak** _[above]_ | Best film soundtracks: **Phantom Thread** by Jonny Greenwood, **A Fantastic Woman** by Matthew Herbert, **You Were Never Really Here** by Jonny Greenwood again, [edited highlights from **Suspiria**](https://open.spotify.com/user/mpaldridge/playlist/2be8QoHthCm1GmvoD4Gbtq?si=PMioFUNsQUmBYN-A5Q6tgw) by Thom Yorke, **If Beale Street Could Talk** by Nicholas Britell | My favourite music writing: [**Rob Sheffield** on Radiohead live in New York](https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-live-reviews/radiohead-2018-tour-concert-review-699529/) | [a playlist](https://open.spotify.com/user/mpaldridge/playlist/6OCdfctiqZ1NLPEIGS4ROA?si=N87htMUgSVWmDNrIvztAwA)

"[**I will admit that I am not well.**](https://www.theguardian.com/society/2018/jun/30/nothing-like-broken-leg-mental-health-conversation) That writing this, right now, I am not well. This will colour the writing. But it is part of why I want to write, because another part of the problem is that we write about it when we are out the other side, better. And I understand: it’s ugly up close; you can see right into the burst vessels of the thing. (Also, on a practical level, it is difficult to write when one is unwell.) But then what we end up with has the substance of secondary sources."

I cried on the train reading **[this essay by Junot Diaz](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2018/04/16/the-silence-the-legacy-of-childhood-trauma)**, but I also believe the people quoted in [this story](https://www.thecut.com/2018/05/author-junot-diaz-accused-of-sexual-misconduct-verbal-abuse.html) | **[Asia Argento's speech at Cannes](https://www.nbcnews.com/video/actress-asia-argento-claims-she-was-raped-by-harvey-weinstein-at-cannes-during-searing-speech-1238073411539)** was just one minute long and took my breath away, but there's also [this story](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asia_Argento#Sexual_assault_allegation_against_Argento)

PODCASTS: **Slate's Culture Gabfest** – for example, on [the dad joke [36:15]](https://slate.com/culture/2018/10/slates-culture-gabfest-on-kidding-uncover-escaping-nxivm-and-dad-jokes.html) | [**Adam Buxton** interviewing Paul Thomas Anderson](http://adam-buxton.co.uk/podcasts/ep63a-paul-thomas-anderson) is very good because no one else would dare open with "The reason I liked There Will Be Blood so much is that Daniel Day Lewis used a funny voice" | **This American Life**: [Five Women](https://www.thisamericanlife.org/640/five-women), [on libraries](https://www.thisamericanlife.org/664/the-room-of-requirement) | **Unpopped** on [Come Dine With Me](https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p06237st) | **The New Yorker Radio Hour**: an hour [on Phillip Roth](https://www.newyorker.com/podcast/the-new-yorker-radio-hour/philip-roths-american-portraits-and-american-prophecy), 15 minutes [weeding with Parker Posey](https://www.wnycstudios.org/story/weeding-parker-posey) | The [BBC radio adaptation of Lucy Prebble's play **The Effect**](https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b09pl824) with Jessie Buckley in it | **Reply All**: [Negative Mount Pleasant](https://www.gimletmedia.com/reply-all/132-negative-mount-pleasant) | You don't need me to tell you whether you want to listen to [Stephen Fry on **No Such Thing as a Fish**](https://audioboom.com/posts/7096220-episode-244-no-such-thing-as-a-fishman) or would rather gnaw your own arm off

**[Six Glimpses of the Past](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2018/10/29/six-glimpses-of-the-past)** by Janet Malcolm (although perhaps you have to be a pre-existing Malcolm fan for this one)

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Cat Power is my favorite musical artist named after two kinds of nap.</p>&mdash; Lauren O&#39;Neal (@laureneoneal) <a href="https://twitter.com/laureneoneal/status/981695848965816321?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">April 5, 2018</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

SPORT: I took the day off work to watch **[Stage 19 of the Giro d'Italia](https://tiz-cycling.racing/videos/giro-ditalia-2018-stage-19-full-stage/)**, which turned out to be a good decision | It seems like another lifetime, but apparently **[England v Colombia in the World Cup](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RbmaLT320hw)** was only six months ago

I have no idea if it's fair, but **[this pan of Jill Soloway's book](https://www.affidavit.art/articles/no-one-wants-it)** by Andrea Long Chu is a dark delight

OLD THINGS I CAME ACROSS THIS YEAR: Kate Bush's **The Dreaming** is so good that it's definitely in the top four Kate Bush albums | **Play It As It Lays** by Joan Didion, which I preferred to her more famous nonfiction | **Consider the Weasel** is, sadly, not the title of [this Annie Dillard essay](https://public.wsu.edu/~hughesc/dillard_weasel.htm) | The original pre-release version of Bob Dylan's **Blood on the Tracks** ([Alex Ross](https://www.newyorker.com/culture/cultural-comment/bob-dylans-masterpiece-is-still-hard-to-find), [Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/user/mpaldridge/playlist/51xIuL7tb2DCoRtb4zaSgw?si=jqUVzMTCShyA8xE0-4j19Q))
