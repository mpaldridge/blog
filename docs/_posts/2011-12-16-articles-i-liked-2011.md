**[Getting Bin Laden](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2011/08/08/getting-bin-laden)  
Nicholas Schmidle, _The New Yorker_**  
"Nine years, seven months, and twenty days after September 11th, an American was a trigger pull from ending bin Laden’s life. The first round, a 5.56-mm. bullet, struck bin Laden in the chest. As he fell backward, the SEAL fired a second round into his head, just above his left eye. On his radio, he reported, 'For God and country—Geronimo, Geronimo, Geronimo.'"

**[The Setup](https://web.archive.org/web/20200920105528/https://www.diablomag.com/people-style/people/the-setup/article_78d23630-bbb4-55e4-8f2a-bd08e5eb4953.html)  
Peter Crooks, _Diablo_**  
"'Between you and me,' Butler said, 'that wasn’t nearly as crazy as some of the stuff that goes on during cases.' 'So, that’s it,' I said. 'Case closed?' 'Case closed,' said Butler. Except, it wasn’t."

**[Crush Point](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2011/02/07/crush-point)  
John Seabrook, _The New Yorker_**  
"The transition from fraternal smooshing to suffocating pressure—a 'crowd crush'—often occurs almost imperceptibly; one doesn’t realize what’s happening until it’s too late to escape. At a certain point, you feel pressure on all sides of your body, and realize that you can’t raise your arms. You are pulled off your feet, and welded into a block of people. The crowd force squeezes the air out of your lungs, and you struggle to take another breath."

**[Anthrax Redux](https://www.wired.com/2011/03/ff-anthrax-fbi/)  
Noah Schachtman, _Wired_**  
"It’s been 10 years since the deadliest biological terror attack in US history launched a manhunt that ruined one scientist’s reputation and saw a second driven to suicide, yet nagging problems remain. Problems that add up to an unsettling reality: Despite the FBI’s assurances, it’s not at all certain that the government could have ever convicted Ivins of a crime."

**[Dr. Don](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2011/09/26/dr-don)  
Peter Hessler, _The New Yorker_**  
"Don talked about all three subjects—neglecting his dying brother, offering credit to the townspeople, and helping Mr. Brick and receiving his gift—in different conversations that spanned more than a year. Don saw connections of a different sort: these people and incidents were more like the spokes of a wheel. They didn’t touch directly, but each was linked to something bigger."
