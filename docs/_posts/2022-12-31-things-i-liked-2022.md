**["People I Punched"](https://therealsarahmiller.substack.com/p/people-i-punched-0f6)** (This was published the morning after Will Smith punched Chris Rock at the Oscars, although I don't think that's necessary knowledge)

[**On Charles Haughey** in particular, and Irish politics in general](https://www.thefitzwilliam.com/p/charles-haughey-irelands-most-enigmatic)

[**Sarah Polley** remembers being a child actor in a Terry Gilliam film](https://www.theguardian.com/books/2022/jun/12/sarah-polley-terry-gilliam-run-towards-danger-baron-munchausen-interview)

[**Peter Hessler on teaching in China:**](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2022/05/16/a-teacher-in-china-learns-the-limits-of-free-expression) "At Chinese universities, when a student reports a professor for political wrongdoing, the verb that’s used to describe this action is *jubao*."

**[Richard Coles:](https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/9a13ce1e-b503-11ec-b9c2-2038a863bceb)** "'How do you do all the things you do?' I am frequently asked, and the answer is by neglecting important things and disappointing people. I was once called in the middle of the night to attend a parishioner’s deathbed and I could not because I was in Glasgow doing *Celebrity Antiques Road Trip*. I found someone to cover, but it should have been me."

[**A *New Yorker* piece** on a painting that might be by Lucian Freud](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2022/09/26/the-case-of-the-disputed-lucian-freud)

[**A voyage on the *Gone Girl* cruise**](https://slate.com/human-interest/2022/10/gone-girl-cruise-review-diary-gillian-flynn.html)

[**In search of a hot pink bitch named Breakfast**](https://defector.com/in-search-of-a-hot-pink-bitch-named-breakfast/)

["**I’ve written here** mostly in the past tense. But the truth is I decided to write this piece because I am still gambling, and I considered that this might be the one thing that could stop me."](https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/nov/20/gambling-addiction-tennis-bet365-online-betting-hannah-jane-parkinson)

[**Merve Emre on Roald Dahl**](https://www.nybooks.com/articles/2022/12/22/making-it-big-roald-dahl-teller-of-the-unexpected/)
