**["In 1998, I helped convict two men of murder. I’ve regretted it ever since."](https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2019/03/juror-revisits-murder-trial-20-years-later.html)** (This piece is surely indebted to the classic – but not very available on the internet – ["Doubt"](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/1994/01/31/doubt-3) by William Finnegan.)

**[A crazy story](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2019/02/11/a-suspense-novelists-trail-of-deceptions)** about the thriller writer Dan Mallory aka AJ Finn.

**[Patricia Lockwood I](https://www.lrb.co.uk/the-paper/v41/n04/patricia-lockwood/the-communal-mind)**: "In contrast with her generation, which had spent most of its time online learning to code so that it could add crude butterfly animations to the backgrounds of its weblogs, the generation immediately following had spent most of its time online making incredibly bigoted jokes in order to laugh at the idiots who were stupid enough to think they meant it. Except after a while they did mean it, and then somehow at the end of it they were white supremacists." 

**[This essay](https://deadspin.com/the-night-the-lights-went-out-1834298070)** about nearly dying from a brain injury and the long recovery from it was somehow maybe the funniest thing I read this year.
