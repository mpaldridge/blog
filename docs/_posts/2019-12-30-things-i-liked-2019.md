**["In 1998, I helped convict two men of murder. I’ve regretted it ever since."](https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2019/03/juror-revisits-murder-trial-20-years-later.html)** (This piece is surely indebted to the classic – but not very available on the internet – ["Doubt"](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/1994/01/31/doubt-3) by William Finnegan.)

**[A crazy story](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2019/02/11/a-suspense-novelists-trail-of-deceptions)** about the thriller writer Dan Mallory aka AJ Finn

**[Patricia Lockwood I](https://www.lrb.co.uk/the-paper/v41/n04/patricia-lockwood/the-communal-mind)**: "In contrast with her generation, which had spent most of its time online learning to code so that it could add crude butterfly animations to the backgrounds of its weblogs, the generation immediately following had spent most of its time online making incredibly bigoted jokes in order to laugh at the idiots who were stupid enough to think they meant it. Except after a while they did mean it, and then somehow at the end of it they were white supremacists." 

**[This essay](https://deadspin.com/the-night-the-lights-went-out-1834298070)** about nearly dying from a brain injury and the long recovery from it was somehow maybe the funniest thing I read this year

**Things-that-look-like-other-things interlude!** [League One football teams that look like David Bowie](https://twitter.com/HannahAlOthman/status/1122954195324342273) \| [Nudibranchs that look like Janelle Monae](https://twitter.com/thomaspoptart/status/1121068374526574592) \| [Nottingham nightclubs that look like Theresa May](https://twitter.com/LilyAdlingt0n/status/1134210523472564246) \| [Logos for Change UK TIG The Independent Group For Change that look like Taylor Swift](https://twitter.com/flashboy/status/1120648812538793985) \| [Pages of the Mueller report that look like Taylor Swift](https://twitter.com/ohcauseshesdead/status/1119050035474264065)

TV: [The lighthouse episode of **Grand Designs**](https://www.channel4.com/programmes/grand-designs/on-demand/62456-002), surely the closest thing to a classical tragedy ever shown on UK television .............

**[A long *New Yorker* piece about a Guantánamo detainee and his guard](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2019/04/22/guantanamos-darkest-secret)**

**[Jeremy's Vine's Boris Johnson story](https://www.facebook.com/1691455784407633/posts/2449074521979085/)**

Yes, **[the Caroline Calloway piece](https://www.thecut.com/2019/09/the-story-of-caroline-calloway-and-her-ghostwriter-natalie.html)**

The brilliance of **[this Slate list of the 25 best characters from the past 25 year](https://slate.com/culture/2019/08/most-important-characters-movies-tv-books-21st-century.html)** is how finely balanced it is between great insightfulness and outright trolling

**[Janet Malcolm on Susan Sontag](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2019/09/23/susan-sontag-and-the-unholy-practice-of-biography)**: "How many of us, who did not start out with Sontag’s disadvantages, have taken the opportunity that she pounced on to engage with the world’s best art and thought? While we watch reruns of 'Law & Order,' Sontag seemingly read every great book ever written."

**[Patricia Lockwood II](https://www.lrb.co.uk/the-paper/v41/n19/patricia-lockwood/malfunctioning-sex-robot)**: "Iwas hired as an assassin. You don’t bring in a 37-year-old woman to review John Updike in the year of our Lord 2019 unless you’re hoping to see blood on the ceiling." (This is so good – if you read one thing on this list, I recommend this.)
