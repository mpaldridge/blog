Last year, *The New Yorker* published ["The Plague Year"](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2021/01/04/the-plague-year), a very long piece by Lawrence Wright about the U.S. response to the coronavirus pandemic. Which made me wonder: Is this the longest *New Yorker* article since I started reading the magazine in 2009? When was the last time the magazine ran an article this long? What are some other long articles from the magazine? The answers are: Yes, 2004, and the following list.

*(Programming notes: Articles have got shorter over time, so the word count needed to get on this list has reduced as we get nearer to now. The list back to 1980 is, I hope, pretty complete; before then it is likely extremely incomplete, and should be seen as a taster of some long articles rather than a complete list. Word counts for properly digitised articles are given to the nearest thousand words; word counts for other articles are roughly estimated from the page count in the magazine; I hope these might be often accurate to within 10%. Sometimes the distinction between "an article" and "a series of articles" is unclear, so I made a knee-jerk decision. Sorry for making such a boring list.)*
