Hi, I'm Matthew Aldridge. I'm a lecturer at the University of Leeds in the School of Mathematics, in the Statistics department.

I study probability, information theory, combinatorics, statistics and related things. I’m particularly interested in group testing, a problem that models testing a large population for a blood disease that also has applications in communications, computer science, genetics and has been used during the Covid pandemic. I’m also interested in ways of coping with interference in large multiuser communications networks.

You might like to look at some of my papers. Good places to find my work include on the arXiv and on Google Scholar. My ORCID is 0000-0002-9347-1586.

At Leeds, in Semester 2 of 2021-22 I am teaching [MATH1710 Probability and Statistics I](https://mpaldridge.github.io/math1710).
