## Current teaching

### [MATH1710 Probability & Statistics I](https://mpaldridge.github.io/math1710/)

I am currently lecturing the module **[MATH1710 Probability and Statistics I](https://mpaldridge.github.io/math1710/)** in Semester 1. The main website for this module is [here](https://mpaldridge.github.io/math1710/).

### Other things

* MATH2900 Maths at Work: I advise a project on "Testing for Covid-19"
* MATH5971M/MATH5872M Dissertation in Statisitcs / Data Science and Analytics: I advise two projects -- "Statistics, politics, law, and gerrymandering" and "Pooled testing for Covid-19"

## Past teaching

### [MATH2750 Introduction to Markov Processes](https://mpaldridge.github.io/math2750/)

From 2018-19 to 2020-21, I lectured the module **[MATH2750 Introduction to Markov Processes](https://mpaldridge.github.io/math2750/)**. The main website for this module was [here](https://mpaldridge.github.io/math2750/). This site reasonably accurately represents the module as it is taught in 2021-22.

### MATH3015 History of Mathematics

In 2019-20, I lectured one third of [MATH3015 History of Mathematics](./math3015/), on History of Statistics, with Dr Phil Walker and Dr Nicola Gambino. Some material is available [here](./math3015/). This module is currently dormant, but might come back one day.

### MA40042 Measure Theory and Integration (Bath)

In 2016-17 at the University of Bath, I lectured one half of [MA40042 Measure Theory and Integration](./ma40042/), on Measure Theory, with Dr Matt Roberts. Some material is available [here](./ma40042/). I don't know if this module exists.

### MATH30002/MATHM0009 Topics in Discrete Mathematics (Bristol)

In 2013-14 at the University of Bristol, I lectured one third of of [MATH30002/MATHM0009 Topics in Discrete Mathematics](./math30002/), on an Introduction to Graph Theory, with Dr Jonathan Bober and Dr Karen Gunderson. Some material is available [here](./math30002/). I believe this module now covers entirely different topics.

## Other

### R Markdown

I have [some notes on using R Markdown and Bookdown](../rmarkdown-draft/). The intended audience is people (particularly people in the School of Mathematics at the University of Leeds) wanting to write accessible online lecture notes.
